# reverseArray

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Whiteboard Process

- create an empty array with the same length as the input array
- iterate over the input array in reverse order and populate the new array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution

python ArrayReverse.py

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

reversed_arr = reverseArray(arr)
print(reversed_arr) -->  Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
