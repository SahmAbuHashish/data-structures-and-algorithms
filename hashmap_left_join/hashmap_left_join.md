# hashmap-left-join

Write a function called left join

1. Arguments: two hash maps

- The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
- The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

2. Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The big o for this approach will be:

- Time complexity:  O(n) 
- Space complexity: O(k) # k is the number of resulting key-value pairs.
