# graph-depth-first

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first
- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
- Program output: Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The big o for this approach will be:

- Time complexity: O(N + M), N # of vertices (nodes) in the graph, M # of edges
- Space complexity: O(N), N # of vertices in the graph.
