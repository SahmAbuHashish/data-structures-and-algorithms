# Trees

Implementation:

- Node

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

- Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth-first traversals:

1. pre-order
2. in order
3. post order

Each depth-first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

- Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class  of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:

1. Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
2. Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
